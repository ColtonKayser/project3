# Project 3: U.S. National Parks Tracker

## About
The United States has sixty-one protected areas overseen by the National Park Service, an agency of the Department of the Interior. The Parks are often created as means of environmental and animal protection, but are also frequently visited by citizens and foreigners alike through tourism.

Our [National Park Tracker](https://nationalpark.herokuapp.com/) lets you search for your favorite parks and NPS destinations by state and add them to a customizable park list where you can edit and delete park information. You can also create a park and add that park to the list.

## API Functionality
Our Find Park form pulls information from the [National Parks Service API] (https://www.nps.gov/subjects/digital/nps-data-api.htm). We accessed data related to each park's name, destination, description, and url by making an AJAX call and then used AngularJS to populate those data points on the page.

We also had our own API
